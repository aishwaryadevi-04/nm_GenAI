# Image Caption Generator

The project aims to develop an image caption generator using deep learning techniques, specifically by combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image feature extraction (ResNet) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for generating captions using Flickr8k dataset.
